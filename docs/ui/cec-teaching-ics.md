# CEC Foundations Series — house-brand teaching ICs

Custom integrated circuits by **Critical Error Computing (CEC)** — invented parts
built *to teach*, not to sell. Each one isolates a single concept at the minimum
honest pin count, so a learner meets the idea without a datasheet's worth of
distraction. They are the house counterpart to the real-part refsheets in
`new-part-refsheets.md`; the owner draws each as a five-tier IC glyph
(`ic-glyph-spec.md`), and each maps to a sim-core element (noted per part).

**CEC house pin convention** (consistent across the whole family, itself a teaching
aid): **pin 1 = primary OUTPUT · pin 2 = GND · middle = inputs/controls · last pin =
VCC.** Every part is single-supply powered (VCC/GND), exactly like the logic gates —
a CEC part is never a bare two-terminal; it always has a rail, so "where does it get
its energy" is always answerable. Logic levels swing GND..VCC; supply 1.8 V–15 V.

**Packages.** Each part ships in a standard small-outline package, drawn over a real frame
per `ic-glyph-spec.md` (a breadboard-friendly DIP exists for the bench): **CEC1041** and
**CEC3007** in **SOT-23-5**, **CEC1083** in **SOT-23-6**, **CEC2018** and **CEC3076**
(7-pin, one N.C. each) and **CEC2064** (all eight pins used) in **SOT-23-8**. The two CEC **logic gates** (below) take the **SOT-23-5** gate footprint and the
74-series single-gate pinout (`1 A · 2 B · 3 GND · 4 Y · 5 VCC`) so they sit beside the real
gates — the output-on-pin-1 convention above is the Foundations Series' own; the gates keep
the JEDEC gate order.

> These are fictional teaching parts. "Specs" are pedagogical, not manufacturing.
> The numbering is `CEC` + a 4-digit code: **1xxx** data-conversion, **2xxx**
> arithmetic/logic, **3xxx** memory/sequential, **4xxx** analog/signal, **5xxx**
> interface/communication.

## CEC1041 — Clocked 1-Bit Quantizer

*Critical Error Computing · "the instant the analog world becomes a number."*

**Description.** The CEC1041 captures one bit of the analog world on command. On the
rising edge of CLK it compares IN against its internal half-rail reference (½·VCC) and
latches the result on Q, which then holds until the next edge. It is the *atom* of
analog-to-digital conversion: stack eight of them against a resistor ladder for a flash
ADC, or wrap one in a feedback loop for successive approximation. There is no real
single-chip equivalent — that is exactly why it exists.

**Features.** Edge-triggered 1-bit capture · output holds between clocks · internal
½·VCC threshold (no reference pin) · rail-to-rail push-pull output · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SC70-5 / SOT-23-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Q** | Latched 1-bit output; holds its value between clock edges. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **IN** | Analog input. Compared against ½·VCC. |
| 4 | **CLK** | Sampling clock. Captures on the LOW→HIGH edge. |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply (1.8–15 V); also sets the ½·VCC threshold. |

**Function.** On CLK↑: `Q ← (V(IN) > VCC/2)`. Otherwise `Q` holds.

**Abs max:** VCC 16 V · IN −0.3 V to VCC+0.3 V · per-clock acquisition is instantaneous
in-sim (the real-world aperture is a teaching annotation).

**In the sim:** maps to `ELEM_SAMPLER` (threshold wired to ½·rail). Golden-safe additive.
**Teaches:** sampling, quantization, the Nyquist limit, the analog↔digital boundary.

## CEC1080 — 3-Bit Flash ADC

*Critical Error Computing · "every threshold at once."*

**Description.** The CEC1080 turns a voltage into a 3-bit number the fast way: in parallel. A
reference ladder splits VREF into seven evenly-spaced levels; seven comparators each ask "is VIN
above my level?" simultaneously; and a priority encoder folds that thermometer of answers into a
3-bit code on D2..D0. No clock, no searching -- one step. It is the upgrade of the CEC1041 (one
comparator, one bit) to a whole bank, and the convert half of the converter pair with the CEC1083
DAC. Flash is the fastest ADC architecture and the most expensive: an N-bit flash needs 2^N - 1
comparators (this 3-bit part has seven), which is why flash is reserved for the highest speeds and
SAR is used where parts matter more than nanoseconds.

**Features.** Parallel (flash) conversion · 3-bit output (8 levels, LSB = VREF/8) · floor
quantization clamped 0..7 · single supply · VREF input (falls back to VCC as full scale if unwired).

**Pin configuration — 7-pin (SOT-23-8 with one N.C., or MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **VIN** | Analog input (sensed, high-Z), measured against VREF. |
| 2 | **VREF** | Reference / full-scale (the top of the ladder). |
| 3 | **D2** | Output code bit 2 (MSB). |
| 4 | **D1** | Output code bit 1. |
| 5 | **D0** | Output code bit 0 (LSB). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |
| 7 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |

**Function.** `code = floor(8 * (VIN - GND) / (VREF - GND))`, clamped to 0..7, presented as binary on
D2 D1 D0. The seven implied comparator thresholds sit at k/8 of full scale (k = 1..7).

**In the sim:** `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program 5 (a parallel quantizer; reads VIN/VREF live, drives the
three code bits, combinational/no state). No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:**
parallel (flash) conversion, the comparator ladder, thermometer-to-binary encoding, the speed-vs-parts
trade against successive approximation, and (with the CEC1083) the full convert <-> reconstruct loop.

---

## CEC1083 — 3-Bit Ladder DAC

*Critical Error Computing · "three switches and a ladder make a voltage."*

**Description.** The CEC1083 turns a 3-bit code into a voltage with nothing but a
resistor R-2R ladder — the most honest digital-to-analog converter there is, because
you can see every resistor doing its job. AOUT settles to the binary-weighted sum of the
three inputs. Pairs naturally with the CEC1041 (quantize in, reconstruct out).

**Features.** Pure R-2R ladder (no op-amp, no reference pin — VCC is the reference) ·
monotonic by construction · inputs are ordinary logic levels · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **AOUT** | Analog output = (code / 8) · VCC. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **D0** | Data bit 0 (LSB, weight 1). |
| 4 | **D1** | Data bit 1 (weight 2). |
| 5 | **D2** | Data bit 2 (MSB, weight 4). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply; the ladder's full-scale reference. |

**Transfer:** `AOUT = (D0·1 + D1·2 + D2·4) / 8 · VCC` — eight steps, 0 V to 7/8·VCC, one
LSB = VCC/8.

**Abs max:** VCC 16 V · D0..D2 are logic inputs (0 / VCC).

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition — an R-2R network of resistors with each 2R
leg tied to its D input net (driven 0/VCC by external logic). No new sim-core element;
reuses the resistor model. **Teaches:** digital→analog, binary weighting, the R-2R ladder,
resolution vs. LSB size.

---

## CEC1108 — 3-Bit SAR ADC

*Critical Error Computing · "guess, weigh, keep or drop, repeat."*

**Description.** The CEC1108 converts by **successive approximation** -- a binary search. It holds one
comparator, one CEC1083-style R-2R DAC, and a 3-bit register wired in a loop. On each clock it tries the
next bit, most-significant first: set the bit, let the DAC produce that trial voltage, and ask the
comparator "is VIN still above it?" -- keep the bit if yes, drop it if no. After 3 clocks the register
holds the code and DONE pulses. One comparator instead of the flash's seven, at the cost of N clocks per
conversion: the speed-versus-parts opposite of the CEC1080 flash ADC.

**Features.** Successive-approximation (binary search) · one comparator + R-2R DAC + 3-bit SAR register ·
3 clocks per conversion · DONE end-of-conversion strobe · VCC the full-scale reference · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 8-pin (SOT-23-8 / MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **VIN** | analog input (sensed), compared against the internal DAC. |
| 2 | **CLK** | conversion clock; one bit is decided per rising edge. |
| 3 | **D2** | result bit 2 (MSB). |
| 4 | **D1** | result bit 1. |
| 5 | **D0** | result bit 0 (LSB). |
| 6 | **DONE** | end-of-conversion: high when the 3-bit result is valid. |
| 7 | **VCC** | supply; the DAC's full-scale reference. |
| 8 | **GND** | ground / 0 V reference. |

**Function.** Binary search over 3 clocks: try D2 (DAC = 4/8 VCC), keep if VIN > DAC else clear; try D1
(DAC = (kept + 2)/8 VCC), keep or clear; try D0; then raise DONE. The result settles to
floor(8 * VIN / VCC), clamped 0..7 -- the same code the CEC1080 finds in parallel.

**In the sim:** a small **behavioral SAR program** (`ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program 6) — on each rising `CLK` it
decides one bit MSB-first, comparing `VIN` against an internal trial R-2R DAC level (`trial/8 * VCC`) and
keeping the bit when `VIN` is above it; after 3 clocks the register holds `floor(8 * VIN / VCC)` (clamped
0..7) and `DONE` goes high. The comparator-DAC-register loop is folded into the one behavioral block (no
new sim-core element). `VCC` is the full-scale reference (single supply, no `VREF` pin). **Teaches:**
successive approximation, the binary search, the comparator-DAC feedback loop, and the speed (N clocks)
versus parts (one comparator) trade against the flash ADC.

## CEC2018 — 1-Bit Full Adder

*Critical Error Computing · "the smallest piece of arithmetic that still counts."*

**Description.** The CEC2018 adds three bits — A, B, and a carry-in — and reports a sum
and a carry-out. Chain N of them carry-to-carry and you have an N-bit adder; it is the
cell every ALU is built from. One glyph, the whole of binary addition.

**Features.** A + B + CIN → {COUT, SUM} · ripple-carry chainable (COUT→CIN of the next) ·
purely combinational · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 7-pin (SC70-8 with one N.C., or MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SUM** | Sum output = A ⊕ B ⊕ CIN. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **A** | Addend bit A. |
| 4 | **B** | Addend bit B. |
| 5 | **CIN** | Carry input (from the next-lower stage). |
| 6 | **COUT** | Carry output = majority(A, B, CIN). |
| 7 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Truth table** (A B CIN → COUT SUM): 000→00 · 001→01 · 010→01 · 011→10 · 100→01 ·
101→10 · 110→10 · 111→11.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of gates (SUM = two XOR; COUT = two AND + OR).
No new sim-core element. **Teaches:** binary addition, carry propagation, how logic
becomes arithmetic, the path to an ALU.

---

## CEC3007 — SR Latch (1-Bit Cell)

*Critical Error Computing · "the first thing a circuit ever remembered."*

**Description.** The CEC3007 is one bit of memory made of feedback: SET drives the output
high and it *stays* high after SET releases; RESET drives it low and it stays. Hold both
low and it remembers. It is the cross-coupled-gate primitive that every flip-flop,
register, and SRAM cell grows from — bistability you can hold in your hand.

**Features.** Set/Reset with hold · active-high inputs · the bistable building block ·
single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SC70-5 / SOT-23-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Q** | Latched output (the remembered bit). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **S** | Set input (HIGH → Q latches HIGH). |
| 4 | **R** | Reset input (HIGH → Q latches LOW). |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function** (S R → Q): 0 0 → hold · 1 0 → 1 · 0 1 → 0 · 1 1 → *invalid* (forbidden; both
gates fight — a deliberate teaching hazard the sim shows as contention).

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of two cross-coupled NOR gates (existing
`ELEM_GATE`), the 1 1 case resolving through the four-state `combine` → `X`. No new
sim-core element. **Teaches:** feedback, bistability, the birth of memory, why the
forbidden state is forbidden.

---

## CEC logic gates (non-standard functions)

Eight of the ten gates ship as real 74-series single-gate parts; two functions have **no
discrete real chip**, so CEC makes them. Each is a 2-input powered gate in the **SOT-23-5**
gate footprint, 74-series pinout (`1 A · 2 B · 3 GND · 4 Y · 5 VCC`), mapping to `ELEM_GATE`
(its function code already lives in the sim). Refsheets: `imply-ic.html`, `nimply-ic.html`.

### CEC2110 — Implication Gate (A → B)

*Critical Error Computing · "if A, then B — in one gate."* `Y = (NOT A) OR B`: low in exactly
one case (A high, B low), high in the other three — the material conditional. Negative-unate
in A, positive-unate in B; the static-CMOS cell is an inverter on B feeding a NAND with A.
**Package:** SOT-23-5. **Truth** (A B → Y): 00→1 · 01→1 · 10→0 · 11→1.

### CEC2111 — Inhibit Gate (A AND NOT B)

*Critical Error Computing · "A, unless B says no."* `Y = A AND (NOT B)`: high in exactly one
case (A high, B low) — the NIMPLY / inhibition function, IMPLY's mirror (it inverts A and
uses a NOR core). **Package:** SOT-23-5. **Truth** (A B → Y): 00→0 · 01→0 · 10→1 · 11→0.

---

## CEC logic & routing (arithmetic, selection, busing)

Five combinational gaps where no clean discrete single-function chip exists at the minimum
pin count — the arithmetic atom below the full adder, the two routing primitives (select and
distribute), the fault-tolerance gate, and the bus driver. Each is a `buildNetlist`
composition of the existing powered `ELEM_GATE` (golden-safe additive), and — like the two
CEC gates above — each keeps the **74-series gate pin order** where it is a single logic
function (`1 A · 2 B · 3 GND · … · VCC last`) so it sits beside the real gates; the wider
parts (mux/demux/latch with a select or enable) revert to the **CEC house convention**
(output pin 1, GND pin 2, VCC last) because they are no longer a bare 2-input gate.

### CEC2024 — 1-Bit Half-Adder

*Critical Error Computing · "addition before it learned to carry in."*

**Description.** The CEC2024 adds two bits and reports a sum and a carry-out — and that is
*all* it does, with no carry-in. It is the rung below the CEC2018 full adder: the half-adder
is the cell at the very least-significant position of a ripple chain (where there is nothing
to carry in yet), and a full adder is literally two half-adders plus an OR. Meeting addition
without the carry-in pin first makes the full adder's third input obvious. There is no
discrete single-gate half-adder chip — it has always been "an XOR and an AND" you wire
yourself, which is exactly the lesson.

**Features.** A + B → {COUT, SUM} · SUM = A ⊕ B, COUT = A · B · purely combinational ·
the bottom rung of a ripple-carry adder · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SUM** | Sum output = A ⊕ B. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **A** | Addend bit A. |
| 4 | **B** | Addend bit B. |
| 5 | **COUT** | Carry output = A · B (chains into a CEC2018's CIN). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply (also the output logic-high rail). |

(A half-adder's defining feature is the carry-*out*, so both outputs are brought out — this is
the cell at the bottom of a ripple chain; add a carry-in and it becomes the CEC2018 full adder.)

**Truth table** (A B → COUT SUM): 00→00 · 01→01 · 10→01 · 11→10.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of two gates — `SUM` = one **XOR**(A,B),
`COUT` = one **AND**(A,B), each a powered `ELEM_GATE` swinging GND..VCC (this is already shipped
as the `logic-half-adder` worked example). No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive.
**Teaches:** binary addition, sum vs. carry, why the full adder needs a third (carry-in) input.

### CEC2031 — 2:1 Multiplexer

*Critical Error Computing · "two wires in, one chosen out."*

**Description.** The CEC2031 passes one of two inputs to the output, chosen by a select line:
`SEL` low forwards A, `SEL` high forwards B. It is the elemental router — the building block
of every larger mux, every data-path "pick a source," and (fed back) the lookup-table cell of
an FPGA. Cascade them in a tree for a 4:1 or 8:1; this is the leaf. No discrete 1-bit 2:1 mux
chip exists at this pin count (the smallest real parts are quad), so CEC lays the single bit
bare.

**Features.** Y = SEL ? B : A · one select line · combinational · the leaf cell of any mux
tree / LUT · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Y** | Output: forwards A when SEL = 0, B when SEL = 1. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **A** | Data input 0 (selected when SEL = 0). |
| 4 | **B** | Data input 1 (selected when SEL = 1). |
| 5 | **SEL** | Select line (0 → A, 1 → B). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function:** `Y = (A · ¬SEL) + (B · SEL)`. **Truth** (SEL → Y): 0 → A · 1 → B.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of gates — an inverter on SEL, two ANDs
(`A·¬SEL`, `B·SEL`), and an OR to merge — all powered `ELEM_GATE`. No new sim-core element;
golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** data selection/routing, the select line, how muxes build
the FPGA lookup table.

### CEC2032 — 1:2 Demultiplexer / 1-of-2 Decoder

*Critical Error Computing · "one wire in, sent to where you point it."*

**Description.** The CEC2031's mirror image. With `D` as data, the CEC2032 steers it to Y0 or
Y1 by the select line (demux); tie `D` high and it becomes a 1-of-2 **decoder** — exactly one
output asserts for each address, the one-hot primitive every memory address line and chip-select
grows from. Distribution is the dual of selection, and meeting them as a matched pair (CEC2031
↔ CEC2032) makes the duality concrete.

**Features.** Demux: routes D to Y0/Y1 by SEL · Decoder (D = 1): one-hot 1-of-2 by address ·
combinational · the address-decode primitive · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Y0** | Output 0 = D · ¬SEL (asserts when SEL = 0). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **Y1** | Output 1 = D · SEL (asserts when SEL = 1). |
| 4 | **D** | Data input (tie HIGH to use as a pure 1-of-2 decoder). |
| 5 | **SEL** | Select / address line. |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function:** `Y0 = D · ¬SEL`, `Y1 = D · SEL`. **Decode** (D = 1, SEL → Y1 Y0): 0 → 01 · 1 → 10.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition — an inverter on SEL and two AND gates
(`D·¬SEL`, `D·SEL`), all powered `ELEM_GATE`. No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive.
**Teaches:** data distribution (the dual of the mux), one-hot decoding, address lines /
chip-select.

### CEC2046 — Majority / Voting Gate (3-input)

*Critical Error Computing · "democracy in a gate — two out of three wins."*

**Description.** The CEC2046 outputs whatever the **majority** of its three inputs say:
high if two or three are high, low otherwise. It is the heart of fault-tolerant logic —
triple-modular redundancy votes out a single failed channel through exactly this gate — and,
not coincidentally, it *is* the carry-out function of a full adder (`COUT = majority(A,B,CIN)`),
so it ties arithmetic and reliability together. No discrete majority-gate chip exists; the
function is fundamental enough (it is monotone, and a primitive of threshold/neuromorphic logic)
to deserve its own glyph.

**Features.** Y = majority(A, B, C) = AB + BC + CA · three inputs · monotone (no inversion) ·
the TMR voter and the full-adder carry · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6), 74-series-style gate order:**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A** | Input A. |
| 2 | **B** | Input B. |
| 3 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 4 | **C** | Input C. |
| 5 | **Y** | Majority output (HIGH when ≥ 2 inputs HIGH). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

(Three inputs + output exceeds the 5-pin single-gate footprint, so it takes the SOT-23-6 gate
frame; pin order follows the gate convention — inputs and GND first, output then VCC — to sit
beside the real 74-series gates rather than the output-on-pin-1 house convention.)

**Truth table** (A B C → Y): 000→0 · 001→0 · 010→0 · 011→1 · 100→0 · 101→1 · 110→1 · 111→1.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition — three two-input **AND** gates (AB, BC, CA) into
a three-input **OR** (itself a tree of two OR gates), all powered `ELEM_GATE` (identical to the
CEC2018 carry network). No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** majority/
threshold logic, triple-modular redundancy (voting out a fault), the full-adder carry as a vote.

### CEC2057 — Tri-State Buffer (with Output Enable)

*Critical Error Computing · "drive it, or get off the bus."*

**Description.** The CEC2057 is a buffer with a third output state: **high-impedance**. When
`OE` is high it passes A to Y (a clean 0 or VCC); when `OE` is low it **releases** Y entirely —
neither high nor low, just disconnected (Hi-Z). That third state is the whole idea of a shared
**bus**: many tri-state drivers on one wire, only one enabled at a time, the rest electrically
absent. It is the part that makes a data bus, a wired backplane, and the `OE` pin on every
memory and register possible. Hi-Z has no waveform, so it must be met as a *concept*, which is
why it earns a dedicated glyph.

**Features.** Y = A when OE = 1; **Hi-Z** when OE = 0 · three output states (0, 1, Z) · the bus
driver / wired-OR enabler · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SOT-23-5 / SC70-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Y** | Three-state output: A when enabled, **high-impedance** when not. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **A** | Data input. |
| 4 | **OE** | Output enable (HIGH = drive Y; LOW = release Y to Hi-Z). |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function** (OE A → Y): 0 X → **Z** · 1 0 → 0 · 1 1 → 1. Two or more CEC2057 outputs may share
one net (a bus) provided **at most one** is enabled; two enabled drivers in disagreement is a
**bus conflict** (the sim resolves it to `X` — a deliberate teaching hazard).

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition over the existing digital domain's **four-state
`Z`**. The honest, golden-safe build is a powered `ELEM_GATE` **buffer** whose VCC rail is
**gated by `OE`** (OE low collapses the rail below `GATE_MIN_RAIL`, so the gate goes
**dead-rail → releases its output to `Z`** — the existing unpowered-gate mechanism); OE high
restores the rail and it drives A. Two such outputs on a net resolve through the IEEE-1164
`combine()` rule (`Z` yields to any real driver; two disagreeing strong drivers → `X`). No new
sim-core element. *(A cleaner native build — a direct `OE`-gated Z without rail-collapse — is
noted in the engine as a future "tri-state buffer with OE" refinement using a dedicated enable
pin; the dead-rail composition above teaches the same Hi-Z behaviour today.)* **Teaches:** the
high-impedance state, shared buses and output-enable, bus contention.

## CEC programmable logic (the configurable cell)

One gap the fixed-function parts above leave open: a gate you **program** instead of pick. Where
every part so far computes one wired-in function, the cell below becomes *any* function you load
into it — and it is the first CEC part backed by the **behavioral engine** (ADR 0004) rather than a
`buildNetlist` gate composition. It is the capstone the CEC2031 mux pointed at ("how muxes build the
FPGA lookup table").

### CEC2064 — Configurable Logic Cell (4-Input LUT + register)

*Critical Error Computing · "sixteen bits that become any gate you can name."*

**Description.** The CEC2064 is a blank gate you fill in. Four inputs address a **sixteen-entry
truth table** loaded at config time, and the addressed bit *is* the output — so one chip is *any*
boolean function of up to four inputs at once: AND, XOR, a 3-input majority, a full-adder carry, a
2:1 mux, anything sixteen bits can describe. Switch on its **registered** mode and the looked-up bit
is latched on each clock edge instead of flowing straight through — a LUT followed by a flip-flop,
which is exactly the **logic element** an FPGA is tiled from. A whole FPGA is a fabric of these cells
plus programmable wiring; meeting one bare is meeting programmable hardware itself. No discrete
single-LUT chip is sold (the closest real parts are configurable-logic gates like the 74LVC1G97, or
the LUT blocks inside a GreenPAK), which is exactly why CEC lays one cell open.

**Features.** Any boolean function of ≤ 4 inputs from a 16-bit truth table · combinational **or**
registered output (a LUT, or a LUT+flip-flop "logic element") · every fixed gate is one table
(AND = `0x8888`, XOR = `0x6666`, 3-input majority = `0xE8E8`) · a fabric of these is any logic or
state machine · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 8-pin (SOT-23-8 / MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Y** | Logic output — the addressed truth-table bit (registered mode: the latched bit, held between clocks). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **I0** | Input bit 0 — truth-table index LSB. |
| 4 | **I1** | Input bit 1. |
| 5 | **I2** | Input bit 2. |
| 6 | **I3** | Input bit 3 — truth-table index MSB. |
| 7 | **CLK** | Clock — registered mode only: latches Y on the LOW→HIGH edge; ignored when combinational. |
| 8 | **VCC** | Positive supply (also the output logic-high rail). |

**Configuration** (set at config time, not pins — a real LUT's truth table lives in config memory,
not on a wire): the **16-bit truth table** `T[0..15]`, and the **mode** (combinational vs registered).

**Function.** Index `n = 8·I3 + 4·I2 + 2·I1 + I0`. Combinational: `Y = T[n]`. Registered: on CLK↑,
`Q ← T[n]`, and `Y = Q` (held until the next edge). Unwired inputs read LOW, so a 2- or 3-input
function just loads a table that ignores the unused high inputs (e.g. XOR(I0,I1) = `0x6666`).

**Abs max:** VCC 16 V · inputs −0.3 V to VCC+0.3 V · the truth table is a config property, not a
runtime signal.

**In the sim:** maps to `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` **program 4** (`BEH_PROG_LUT`) — the truth table rides in
`aux` (low 16 bits), the mode in `params[4]` (≥ 1 → registered), and the pins map **Y→a · GND→e ·
I0/I1/I2→f/g/h · I3→c · CLK→b · VCC→d**. A combinational cell carries no state; a registered one
folds only its `Q`/`clk_prev`, through the existing `beh_state` hash loop — **golden-safe by
construction** (no golden circuit carries a behavioral block). The first CEC part backed by the
behavioral engine rather than a gate composition. **Teaches:** that all combinational logic is a
lookup table; programmability (one cell, any function); the FPGA logic element (LUT + register); how
a fabric of LUTs becomes any circuit (the path to a soft core). **Refsheet:** `lut-ic.html`.

## CEC memory & sequential (level vs. edge)

### CEC3014 — Transparent D-Latch

*Critical Error Computing · "memory with the door propped open."*

**Description.** The CEC3014 stores one bit, but unlike a flip-flop it is **level-sensitive**:
while `EN` is high the latch is *transparent* — Q simply follows D — and the instant `EN` goes
low it **freezes** the last value of D and holds it. It is the missing middle term between the
CEC3007 (an SR latch — feedback memory, but no clean data input) and an edge-triggered D
flip-flop (the 74LVC1G80, which samples D only on a clock *edge*). Putting the transparent latch
beside the edge flip-flop is the cleanest way to teach **level- vs. edge-triggered** — the
single most confused distinction in sequential logic (and the source of every latch-vs-flop
timing bug). No discrete single D-latch is sold at this pin count.

**Features.** Transparent when EN = 1 (Q follows D), holds last D when EN = 0 · level-sensitive
(not edge) · the gated-latch building block (a flip-flop is two of these) · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Q** | Latched output: follows D while EN = 1, holds when EN = 0. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **D** | Data input. |
| 4 | **EN** | Enable / gate (HIGH = transparent, LOW = hold). |
| 5 | **Q̄** | Complementary output. |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function** (EN D → Q): 1 0 → 0 · 1 1 → 1 · 0 X → **hold**.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of gates — a gated SR latch: two steering ANDs
(`D·EN`, `¬D·EN`) into the cross-coupled NOR pair of the CEC3007 (so when EN = 0 both set/reset
terms are forced low and the latch *holds*; when EN = 1 it tracks D). All powered `ELEM_GATE`,
resolving through the four-state `combine`. No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive.
(The level-sensitive latch the engine already implements inside `ELEM_COMPARATOR`'s active-low
`LE` enable is the *analog* cousin of this digital latch — same transparent-vs-hold idea.)
**Teaches:** level- vs. edge-triggered storage, transparency vs. hold, that a flip-flop is two
latches in series.

### CEC3076 — JK / T Flip-Flop (the universal flip-flop)

*Critical Error Computing · "every flip-flop in one — and the toggle that counts."*

**Description.** The CEC3076 is the **universal** edge-triggered flip-flop: on each rising CLK edge
J and K choose the next state — hold (0 0), set (1 0), reset (0 1), or **toggle** (1 1) — the one
flip-flop that does all four. The toggle is the prize: tie **J and K together** and it becomes a
**T (toggle) flip-flop**, flipping its output on every clock while T = 1, so Q emerges at **half the
clock frequency** — the divide-by-2 cell every binary counter and frequency divider is built from.
The JK is also the SR latch with its forbidden state redeemed: where SET = RESET = 1 was illegal on
the CEC3007, here J = K = 1 is the *most useful* case of all. No single JK is sold at this pin count
(the real parts — 74x76, 74x112, CD4027 — are all **duals**), so CEC brings one flop out bare; it is
the edge-triggered companion to the real D flip-flop (`dff-ic.html`, 74AUP1G79).

**Features.** Edge-triggered J/K — hold / set / reset / **toggle** · tie J = K for a **T flip-flop**
(divide-by-2) · the universal flip-flop (D and T are both special cases) · complementary Q̄ for
divider chains · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 7-pin (SC70-8 with one N.C., or MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Q** | Latched output (updates only on the clock edge). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **J** | Set-side input (J = 1, K = 0 → Q latches HIGH). |
| 4 | **K** | Reset-side input (J = 0, K = 1 → Q latches LOW). **Tie to J for T-mode.** |
| 5 | **CLK** | Clock — samples J/K on the LOW→HIGH edge. |
| 6 | **Q̄** | Complementary output (chain Q̄→CLK of the next stage for a ripple counter). |
| 7 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function** (J K, on CLK↑ → next Q): 0 0 → Q (hold) · 1 0 → 1 (set) · 0 1 → 0 (reset) · 1 1 → Q̄
(toggle). Characteristic equation `Q⁺ = J·Q̄ + K̄·Q`. **T-mode** (J = K = T): `Q⁺ = T ⊕ Q` — toggles
when T = 1, holds when T = 0.

**Abs max:** VCC 16 V · inputs −0.3 V to VCC+0.3 V.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition — an edge-triggered `ELEM_DFF` (the memory; `Q = a`,
`D = b`, `CLK = c`, `Q̄ = d`) fed by JK **steering logic** that computes its D input
`D = (J · Q̄) + (¬K · Q)` from powered `ELEM_GATE`s (an inverter on K, two ANDs, an OR), with the
DFF's own Q (`a`) and Q̄ (`d`) closing the feedback. Because the DFF samples only on the edge, the
J = K = 1 case is a clean **toggle** with no latch race — the master-slave problem the real JK
solved, here solved for free by the edge trigger. No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive.
**Teaches:** the universal flip-flop and its four modes, toggle / divide-by-2 (the counter cell),
how D and T are JK special cases, and why the SR forbidden state becomes JK's most useful one.
**Refsheet:** `jkff-ic.html`.

## CEC analog & signal (sources, references, detectors)

Five analog gaps. Each maps to a real sim-core element or a short composition, and each is
single-supply powered (the CEC rule — a reference or a current source you can ask "where does
its energy come from").

### CEC4007 — Constant-Current Source/Sink

*Critical Error Computing · "amps held as steady as a reference holds volts."*

**Description.** The CEC4007 pushes (or pulls) a **fixed current** through whatever you connect
to IOUT, regardless of the load voltage — the current-domain dual of a voltage reference. Drive
an LED at a constant brightness, bias a sensor, charge a capacitor into a perfect linear ramp,
or set the tail current of a differential pair: anywhere the *current* must be the controlled
quantity, not a by-product of `V/R`. Real "current sources" are awkward (a current-regulator
diode is a depletion JFET; a current mirror needs matched transistors) — CEC gives you the ideal
behaviour laid bare so you meet the *idea* of a held current before its imperfect
implementations.

**Features.** Fixed IOUT independent of load voltage (ideal source impedance) · source **or**
sink by orientation · compliance set by the supply rail · the dual of a voltage reference ·
single supply.

**Pin configuration — 4-pin (SOT-23-5 with one N.C., or SOT-23 leadframe):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IOUT** | Constant-current terminal (delivers/draws the set current). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference and return. |
| 3 | **ISET** | Sets the output current (a resistor to GND, or a fixed internal value). |
| 4 | **VCC** | Positive supply; sets the output-voltage compliance range. |

**Transfer:** `IOUT = I_set` for all load voltages within compliance (`0 < V(IOUT) < VCC − V_dropout`);
the source "runs out of headroom" (drops out of regulation) outside that window — a teaching
annotation.

**In the sim:** maps directly to **`ELEM_ISOURCE`** (an ideal DC current source: a pure
right-hand-side KCL stamp, no branch unknown, no reactive state — `value` is the set current in
amps). This is exactly how the existing electronic-**LOAD** part in CC mode already maps. No new
sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** current as a controlled quantity, source
vs. sink, compliance/headroom, the duality with a voltage reference.

### CEC4012 — Buffered Voltage Reference

*Critical Error Computing · "one voltage you can trust, on tap."*

**Description.** The CEC4012 produces a **stable, low-impedance reference voltage** on VREF —
the anchor every ADC, DAC, comparator threshold and regulator measures against. Unlike a bare
shunt reference (e.g. the real LM4040, a two-terminal part that needs an external bias resistor
and sinks into a high impedance), the CEC4012 buffers its internal reference so VREF is a
**ready-to-use output** you can wire straight to a divider or an ADC pin — the teaching-optimized
abstraction: the concept "a fixed voltage, independent of supply and load," with the bias network
hidden. Its precision (and, in Real mode, its tempco) is the lesson in *why* references are hard.

**Features.** Fixed VREF independent of supply (above dropout) and of load (buffered, low-Z out) ·
the measurement anchor for ADC/DAC/regulator · internal shunt core, buffered to an output · single
supply.

**Pin configuration — 4-pin (SOT-23-5 with one N.C., or SC70):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **VREF** | Buffered reference output (fixed voltage, low impedance). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **SET** | Selects the reference value (internal tap; pin reserved for trim/option). |
| 4 | **VCC** | Positive supply (must exceed VREF + dropout). |

**Transfer:** `VREF = V_ref` (a fixed value, e.g. 2.5 V), held flat while `VCC > VREF + V_dropout`
and across rated load current.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition — an **`ELEM_ZENER`** (its `value` = the breakdown
`Vz`, the stable reference core) biased from VCC through a resistor, then **buffered by an
`ELEM_OPAMP`** in a unity follower so VREF is low-impedance. Both are existing elements; the
Zener's reverse-breakdown model and the op-amp follower are already in the solve. No new sim-core
element; golden-safe additive. (A real temperature-stable bandgap reference — where two opposing
tempcos cancel — is the Real-mode / thermal-`Tj` refinement noted on the roadmap; the Zener core
here teaches the *function* of a reference today.) **Teaches:** a supply-independent reference,
why downstream accuracy rides on it, shunt core vs. buffered output, source/load regulation.

### CEC4023 — Window Comparator

*Critical Error Computing · "in range, or out — one bit for both edges."*

**Description.** The CEC4023 asserts a single output when the input sits **between** a low and a
high threshold, and de-asserts when it strays past either — a "good/bad," "in-band," or "valid
range" detector in one part. A plain comparator answers *above or below one level*; the window
comparator answers *inside or outside a band*, which is what undervoltage/overvoltage supervision,
go/no-go testing, and bracketed alarms actually need. Building it from two comparators makes the
band visible as two stacked thresholds.

**Features.** GOOD = (V_LO < IN < V_HI) · two thresholds bracketing a band · combinational
decision · the supervisor / go-no-go primitive · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **GOOD** | Output: HIGH while V_LO < IN < V_HI, else LOW. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **IN** | Analog input to test against the window. |
| 4 | **VLO** | Lower threshold (analog). |
| 5 | **VHI** | Upper threshold (analog). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply (output logic-high rail). |

**Transfer:** `GOOD = (IN > VLO) AND (IN < VHI)` — high only inside the band, low above VHI or
below VLO.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of **two `ELEM_COMPARATOR`** (the ADCMP601-modelled
latched comparator, used in plain mode: `value` = 0 for no hysteresis, `LE` unwired so it runs
transparent) — one testing `IN > VLO`, one testing `VHI > IN` — merged by one powered **AND**
`ELEM_GATE`. All existing elements; the comparators drive clean digital levels the gate ANDs. No
new sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** thresholds and bands, combining
comparisons, voltage supervision (UV/OV), go/no-go testing.

### CEC4031 — Peak Detector

*Critical Error Computing · "it remembers the highest it ever saw."*

**Description.** The CEC4031 captures and **holds the peak** of its input: as IN rises, OUT
follows it up; when IN falls, OUT *stays* at the highest value reached (until reset). It is how
an envelope is extracted from a waveform — AM demodulation, an audio VU/peak meter, capturing a
transient's amplitude, an envelope follower. The mechanism is a one-way valve into a reservoir
(charge the cap on the way up, block it on the way down), so the part teaches rectify-and-store
directly. No tidy single-chip peak detector exists in jellybean form; it has always been a diode,
a capacitor, and (for precision) an op-amp.

**Features.** OUT tracks IN upward, holds the maximum when IN falls · diode-into-capacitor
charge store · envelope / peak capture · optional reset · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SOT-23-5 / SC70-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OUT** | Peak output: rises with IN, holds the maximum reached. |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **IN** | Analog input whose peak is captured. |
| 4 | **RST** | Reset (discharges the hold capacitor toward GND). |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Transfer:** `OUT = max(IN)` since the last reset (precision version cancels the diode drop);
`OUT` decays slowly per the hold time (a teaching annotation) and snaps to ~0 on RST.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of existing elements — an **`ELEM_DIODE`** (one-way
charge path) into an **`ELEM_CAPACITOR`** (the reservoir, a backward-Euler companion that *holds*
charge between updates), with RST modelled as a switched/resistive bleed to GND; the **precision**
variant wraps an **`ELEM_OPAMP`** around the diode (the follower charges the cap to the true peak,
cancelling the forward drop). All existing elements; the cap's reactive state is what gives the
hold. No new sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** rectify-and-store, envelope
detection, the diode as a one-way valve, capacitor charge storage / hold.

### CEC4044 — Transconductance Cell (V→I)

*Critical Error Computing · "voltage in, current out — the thing a transistor really is."*

**Description.** The CEC4044 turns an input **voltage** into an output **current**: `IOUT = gm ·
VIN`. That voltage-to-current conversion — *transconductance* — is the actual primitive a
transistor performs (a MOSFET's gate voltage sets its drain current; the engine literally
linearizes every active device into a `gm`), and it is the core of an operational transconductance
amplifier (OTA), a gm-C filter, and a multiplier. Exposing gm by itself — as a single cell whose
output is a current you watch flow — demystifies what "gain" is before it is buried inside an
op-amp. The real OTA (e.g. an LM13700) is a multi-pin dual with bias and buffer pins; CEC strips
it to the one idea.

**Features.** IOUT = gm · VIN (voltage controls a current) · the OTA / gm-C core · the
transistor's defining action laid bare · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SOT-23-5 / SC70-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IOUT** | Output current, proportional to VIN (sourced/sunk into the load). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference and source return. |
| 3 | **VIN** | Control input voltage (relative to GND). |
| 4 | **IABC** | Sets gm (amplifier bias current); pin reserved for the gm control. |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Transfer:** `IOUT = gm · VIN` over the linear range (square-law/tanh roll-off at large |VIN|,
exactly as the device model bends — a teaching annotation), with gm set by IABC.

**In the sim:** maps to a single **`ELEM_NMOS`** (drain = IOUT, source = GND, gate = VIN): the
MOSFET *is* a transconductor — the core linearizes it into a transconductance `gm` (from the gate)
and an output conductance `gds`, which is precisely `IOUT = gm·VGS`. (A more ideal V→I — a true
voltage-controlled current source independent of output voltage — is an op-amp + sense-resistor
Howland composition, also from existing elements, if `gds`-flatness matters.) No new sim-core
element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** transconductance (V→I), what gain *is* at the device
level, the OTA / gm-C building block.

### CEC4055 — Analog Sample-and-Hold

*Critical Error Computing · "a voltage, frozen in time."*

**Description.** The CEC4055 follows its analog input while TRACK is high and, the instant TRACK
goes low, **freezes** the input's value on OUT and holds it steady. It is the front end of every
ADC (catch the input so it cannot move mid-conversion), the deglitcher on a DAC, and the analog
memory in any multiplexed measurement. Where the CEC1041 captures one *bit*, the CEC4055 holds the
full analog *value*.

**Features.** Track-and-hold of an analog value · follows IN when TRACK = 1, freezes when TRACK = 0
· the ADC front-end / analog memory · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 5-pin (SOT-23-5 / SC70-5):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OUT** | Held analog output (follows IN, or holds the frozen value). |
| 2 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |
| 3 | **IN** | Analog input to track / sample. |
| 4 | **TRACK** | HIGH = follow IN (sample); LOW = freeze (hold). |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |

**Function.** TRACK = 1 → `OUT` tracks `IN`; TRACK = 0 → `OUT` holds the last sampled value.

**In the sim:** a `buildNetlist` composition of existing elements — the new **`ELEM_ASWITCH`**
(CTRL = TRACK) feeding a hold **`ELEM_CAPACITOR`** to GND, buffered by an **`ELEM_OPAMP`** unity
follower so OUT is low-impedance and never loads the cap. TRACK high closes the switch and the cap
follows IN; TRACK low opens it and the cap's backward-Euler companion **holds** the charge — the
exact mechanism the gated switch was built for (proven by the `aswitch_sample_and_hold` test). No
new sim-core element; golden-safe additive. **Teaches:** track-and-hold, analog memory, the ADC
front end, why the hold cap and a clean switch matter.

## CEC interface / communication (5xxx)

The serial blocks. Where the rest of the Foundations Series is combinational gates and bistables, these
are **little finite-state machines that move a word over wires one bit at a time** -- the bridge from a
parallel register to a serial link. Each is a real `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program in the sim (a shift register
plus a control FSM), so the glyph teaches at the **register-transfer level**: a shift register drawn as a
chain of real flip-flops, a bit counter, and the clock/framing logic. The pair CEC5021 (master) and
CEC5022 (slave) are the two ends of one SPI bus; CEC5232 is the clockless asynchronous cousin.

### CEC5021 — SPI Master (4-Wire Synchronous Bus Controller)

*Critical Error Computing · "one clock to run the bus."*

**Description.** The CEC5021 is the master of a Serial Peripheral Interface link, and it owns the clock.
Pulse START and it pulls CS low, then shifts its data word out on MOSI most-significant-bit first, one bit
per SCLK pulse, while simultaneously clocking the peripheral's reply in on MISO -- out and in on the same
edges, which is what full-duplex buys you. Four wires, no addressing, no agreed baud rate to get wrong:
the fastest short-range link there is.

**Features.** SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0) · MSB-first · full-duplex · master-driven SCLK · single
supply.

**Pin configuration — 7-pin (SOT-23-8 with one N.C., or MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SCLK** | Serial clock, master-driven (idles low in Mode 0). |
| 2 | **MOSI** | Master-out / slave-in: the word shifted out, MSB first. |
| 3 | **MISO** | Master-in / slave-out: the reply, sampled on the rising edge. |
| 4 | **CS** | Chip select (active-low; asserted for the whole transfer). |
| 5 | **START** | Trigger: a rising edge begins one transaction. |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |
| 7 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |

**Function.** On START rising: CS goes low; then for each of N bits, MOSI presents the next bit and SCLK
pulses while MISO is sampled on the rising edge; after N bits CS releases high.

**In the sim:** `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program 1 (data word in `aux`; SCLK half-period and bit count in
`params`). No new sim-core element. **Teaches:** synchronous serial, MSB-first shifting, full-duplex,
chip-select framing.

---

### CEC5022 — SPI Slave (Clocked Peripheral)

*Critical Error Computing · "speak only when clocked."*

**Description.** The other end of the SPI bus. The CEC5022 has no clock of its own -- it is driven
entirely by the master's SCLK. While CS is held low it samples MOSI on each clock edge to receive the
incoming word and at the same time shifts its own reply out on MISO, MSB first, so a read and a write
happen in one transaction. RXVALID rises once a full word has landed. Every real SPI peripheral -- a
sensor, a flash, a display -- is this: select it, clock a command in, clock the answer out, on the same
edges.

**Features.** SPI Mode 0 receiver/transmitter · MSB-first · clocked by external SCLK · RXVALID strobe ·
single supply.

**Pin configuration — 7-pin (SOT-23-8 with one N.C., or MSOP-8):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **MISO** | Master-in / slave-out: the reply word, shifted out MSB first. |
| 2 | **RXVALID** | High once a full word has been received. |
| 3 | **SCLK** | Serial clock input (from the master). |
| 4 | **MOSI** | Master-out / slave-in: incoming data, sampled on the rising edge. |
| 5 | **CS** | Chip select (active-low; frames the transfer). |
| 6 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |
| 7 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |

**Function.** While CS is low: on each SCLK rising edge, sample MOSI into the receive register and shift
the reply out on MISO; at the frame end, raise RXVALID.

**In the sim:** `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program 2 (reply word in `aux`; bit count in `params`). **Teaches:** the
slave half of synchronous serial, shift-in / shift-out, the role of chip-select.

---

### CEC5232 — UART (Asynchronous Serial Port)

*Critical Error Computing · "two wires, no clock, an agreement on speed."*

**Description.** The CEC5232 is an asynchronous serial port -- the venerable two-wire link under every
serial console, and the RS-232 line it is named for. There is no shared clock: both ends agree a baud
rate beforehand and frame each byte. The idle-high TX line drops for one START bit (the receiver's cue),
then the data bits go out least-significant-bit first, then a STOP bit returns the line high. The receiver
watches RX for the falling start edge and samples each bit in the middle of its window, so small clock
differences do not matter. Slower than SPI, but it needs no clock wire.

**Features.** Async (no clock) · 8-N-1 framing (START + 8 data LSB-first + STOP) · full-duplex
(independent TX and RX) · agreed baud rate · single supply.

**Pin configuration — 6-pin (SOT-23-6 / SC70-6):**

| Pin | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **TX** | Transmit line (idle high; framed START + data + STOP). |
| 2 | **RX** | Receive line (sampled for the falling START edge). |
| 3 | **RXVALID** | One-tick pulse when a received byte completes. |
| 4 | **SEND** | Trigger: a rising edge transmits the data word. |
| 5 | **VCC** | Positive supply. |
| 6 | **GND** | Ground / 0 V reference. |

**Function.** On SEND rising: frame the data word on TX as START (low) + N data bits LSB-first + STOP
(high). On RX: a falling edge starts reception; sample N bits at the agreed baud (mid-bit); pulse RXVALID
when the byte lands.

**In the sim:** `ELEM_BEHAVIORAL` program 3 (data word in `aux`; baud divider and bit count in `params`).
**Teaches:** asynchronous serial, START/STOP framing, baud rate, mid-bit sampling, the timing edge of a
comms link.

---

## Parts that wait on an engine mechanism

The **gated analog switch landed** (`ELEM_ASWITCH`), so the sample-and-hold above — and with it
**switched-capacitor** circuits (switches + caps standing in for resistors) and the **analog mux**
(one switch per channel + a decoder) — are now buildable from existing elements. What still waits
on a not-yet-built mechanism is **named here but not given a full card** (it would otherwise
mis-teach against the sim):
- **Voltage-controlled oscillator (V→frequency)** — every time-varying source (`ELEM_ACSOURCE`,
  the PULSE/SWITCH mapping) takes its frequency as a **fixed param**, a pure function of `tick`, not
  of a live node voltage. A true VCO is **[needs: a voltage-controlled time-varying source]** (a
  frequency that reads a control node each tick) — deferred with the behavioral/multi-rate work.
- **Monostable one-shot** (retriggerable edge → fixed-width pulse) — the *core* is buildable today
  (comparator + RC + the CEC3007 SR latch), but a clean **retriggerable** one-shot wants the same
  edge-to-timer plumbing the 555 monostable uses; partially buildable, deprioritized in favour of
  using the real **LMC555** (which has a clean minimum-pin part) for timing.
- **Clock divider (÷N)** — deliberately **skipped**: the single D flip-flop (real **74LVC1G80**,
  5-pin) with `Q̄→D` already *is* the ÷2 divider stage, so a CEC version would duplicate a clean
  real minimum-pin exemplar (see `new-part-refsheets.md`). Chain N flip-flops for ÷2ⁿ.

---

## The arc

Read together, the original four are a tiny computer in kit form: **CEC1041** quantizes the
world in, **CEC2018** computes on it, **CEC3007** remembers the result, **CEC1083** turns it
back into a voltage. Convert → compute → store → reconstruct, each a single CEC glyph,
each at its minimum honest pin count — and (with the existing sampler/gate/resistor
elements) each buildable in-sim today, golden-safe, the moment its refsheet is drawn.

The second wave widens that spine into the rest of the curriculum without leaving the same
ground: **route and compute** (the half-adder CEC2024, the mux/demux pair CEC2031/CEC2032,
the voter CEC2046, the bus driver CEC2057), **the level-vs-edge bridge in memory** (the
transparent latch CEC3014, sitting between the SR latch and the flip-flop), and **the analog
anchors and detectors** (a held current CEC4007, a buffered reference CEC4012, a window
CEC4023, a peak hold CEC4031, and transconductance itself CEC4044). Every one is the same
contract as the first four — minimum honest pins, always powered, output-on-pin-1 (or the
74-series order for a bare gate), and a real sim backend: a powered-gate composition, a single
`ELEM_ISOURCE` / `ELEM_ZENER` / `ELEM_NMOS`, or a pair of `ELEM_COMPARATOR`s — all golden-safe
additive. The gated analog switch (`ELEM_ASWITCH`) since landed, pulling the sample-and-hold
(and switched-cap, and the analog mux) onto that same ground. The few honest gaps that remain (a
true V→frequency VCO, a retriggerable one-shot) are named, not faked: they wait on a named engine
mechanism so no glyph ever teaches something the simulator cannot do.
