# HANDOFFS

The most recent handoff is at the **top**. When you stop work, prepend a new
dated section so the next agent can pick up cleanly. Keep it concise and current.

## 2026-06-14 — Parallel panel landed: M1 + M2 + design polish

**State:** 🟢 Green. Three parallel agents (isolated git worktrees) integrated
cleanly into this branch; the full gate suite passes on the integrated tree.

### What changed since the bootstrap
- **M2 — analog core (Lane A).** `crates/sim-core` now runs a real deterministic
  analog engine: backward-Euler companion models assembled by Modified Nodal
  Analysis, solved each fixed tick by a bounded dense Gaussian elimination
  (fixed order, partial pivot). Circuit = RC charge (V → R → C → gnd).
  `state()` = `[v(n1), v(cap), i(src), v(rail)]` (volts/amps). Committed golden
  `0x92349dbbbf5a8293` (seed 42, 1000 steps). `sim-wasm` adds `cap_voltage()`;
  all prior method names unchanged.
- **M1 — interactive board (Lane B).** `web/src/lib/graph.ts` (board model) plus
  a rewritten `board.ts` (PixiJS scene + input). Drag a part from the bin to
  place it, click-drag pin→pin to wire, drag to move, right-click to delete,
  Select/Place/Wire mode toggle + Clear. Renderer & telemetry iterate the live
  `state().length` (no hardcoded channel count).
- **Polish (Lane C).** Fonts self-hosted under `web/public/fonts/` (Google CDN
  removed); CRT/scanline scope frame, full button/chip/telemetry state matrices,
  neon glows, `prefers-reduced-motion`. Token values unchanged.

### ⚠️ Important seam for the next agent
The interactive board and the simulator are **not yet connected.** The core
solves a *fixed* RC circuit; placing/wiring parts builds a `BoardGraph` that is
**not yet fed to the solver.** The top backlog item is to compile the board
graph into a netlist the core solves (see `TODOS.md`).

### Integration mechanics (FYI)
Each lane worked in an isolated worktree branched from the bootstrap base and was
cherry-picked here (the lanes touched disjoint files, so no conflicts). The
ephemeral worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` are gitignored and were removed
after integration.

How to verify is unchanged (see CLAUDE.md). Branch `claude/kind-turing-hdelb3`; no PR opened.

## 2026-06-14 — Repository bootstrap + first design pass

**State:** 🟢 Green. Every verification gate passes from a clean checkout.

### What exists now
- **Cargo workspace** (`Cargo.toml`) with three crates:
  - `crates/sim-core` — deterministic fixed-step placeholder `Sim`, FNV-1a
    `snapshot_hash`, `run_is_reproducible` test, ignored `print_golden`. Added a
    read-only `state()` accessor for rendering (does not affect determinism).
  - `crates/sim-protocol` — wire types only (`PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `NodeId`, `PinId`).
  - `crates/sim-wasm` — wasm-bindgen `Simulation` exposing
    `step/tick/state/protocol_version/snapshot_hash`. `wasm-opt` disabled here.
- **Web app** (`web/`) — Vite 8 + Svelte 5 + TS + PixiJS 8. CEC-styled HUD:
  component bin (tech-tree preview), oscilloscope board rendering the live
  deterministic snapshot as auto-ranged traces, telemetry panel, and transport
  controls (run/pause/step + 1×/4×/16×/64× speed). The JS↔wasm boundary is
  crossed once per frame in `web/src/sim/loop.ts`.
- **Design system** mirrored from criticalerrorcomputing.com — tokens in
  `web/src/app.css`, hex mirrors in `web/src/lib/board.ts`.
- **CI** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`rust-core`, `web-build`).
- **Docs** `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/determinism.md`, `docs/adr/0001-tech-stack.md`,
  and `docs/game-design.md` (pillars, tech tree, challenge/grading, milestones M0–M5).
  Legal: `LICENSE` (canonical Apache-2.0), `NOTICE`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Self-heal hook** `.claude/hooks/` + `.claude/settings.json` — installs the
  wasm toolchain on ephemeral containers and surfaces these docs at session start.

### How to verify (full list in CLAUDE.md)
```
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy -p sim-core -p sim-protocol --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p sim-core -p sim-protocol
pnpm run build:wasm
pnpm -C web check && pnpm -C web lint && pnpm -C web build
```

### Intentional deviations from the runbook (all documented)
- `wasm-opt` disabled in `crates/sim-wasm/Cargo.toml` — binaryen is not fetchable
  in the sandbox. Re-enable when the build image provides it.
- Added `Simulation.state()` so the renderer can read the snapshot. Read-only.
- `lint` = Prettier + ESLint flat config (svelte + ts), both green.

### Pick up here
- The placeholder `Sim` is a scaffold. The next substantive work is the real
  **mixed-signal engine** — start in `crates/sim-core/src/lib.rs` against
  `docs/architecture.md`, preserving the determinism invariants.
- Branch: `claude/kind-turing-hdelb3`. No PR opened yet — open against `main`
  when the owner is ready (do not push to `main`).
- See `TODOS.md` for the prioritized backlog.
